# AJAX 
asynchronous javascript and XML where as The XML is a type of file that we dont use now /

# HTTP request
is a set of "web development techniques"  using many web technologies on the "client-side "
to create asynchronous web applications. 


With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve 
 data from a server asynchronously (in the background) 
without interfering with the display and 
 behaviour of the existing page

We don't use data in XML format anymore. we use JSON now. 


# we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
1.) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing) Dont Worry We dont hit thos thing that is not going to use 
2.) fetch API (new way of doing) Hit the nail on head

 3.) axios (this is third party library)
