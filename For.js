// The syntax of a for loop in JavaScript follows a specific structure:
// for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
//   // Code to be executed
// }

// The initialization step is where you declare and initialize the loop variable. It usually starts with let or var followed by the variable name.
// The condition is the test that determines whether the loop should continue or terminate. It is evaluated before each iteration, and if it evaluates to true, the loop continues. Otherwise, it terminates.
// The iteration step is executed after each iteration and is responsible for modifying the loop variable. It can be used to increment or decrement the variable.


// for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
//     // Code to be executed
//   }

// for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
//     console.log("Iteration:", i);
//   }
