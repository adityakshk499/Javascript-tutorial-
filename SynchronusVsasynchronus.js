console.log("Script Start")

for (let index = 0; index < 10000; index++) {
    console.log('...')    
}

console.log("script Completed")


// js is synchronus programming language thats why you can see easily that the for loop is a blocking code in our example it is excuted line by line when one is completed than only its going to execute another
