// A do-while loop is a type of loop in JavaScript that executes 
// a block of code and then checks a condition. If the condition evaluates to true,
//  the loop continues to execute the code block repeatedly. The loop continues until the condition
//   evaluates to false. The do-while loop is commonly used when you want to ensure that the code block is
//    executed at least once,
//  regardless of the condition's initial value.

// do {
//     // Code to be executed
//   } while (condition);

var i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i = 0);

    // The do keyword initiates the loop and marks the beginning of the code block.
    // The code block within the curly braces {} contains the statements to be executed.
    // The while keyword is followed by the condition that determines whether the loop should continue.
    // The condition is enclosed in parentheses ().
